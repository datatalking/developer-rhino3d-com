By the end of this guide, you should have all the tools installed necessary for authoring, building, and debugging C/C++ plugins using the Rhino C/C++ SDK on Windows.

## Prerequisites

This guide presumes you have:

- A PC running Microsoft Windows 7 or later.
- [The Rhino Work-In-Progress (WIP)](https://www.rhino3d.com/download/rhino/wip).

## Install Visual Studio
In order to author, build, and debug C/C++ plugins for Rhino, you will need Microsoft [Visual Studio 2017](https://www.visualstudio.com/en-us/visual-studio-homepage-vs.aspx).

Visual Studio 2017 comes in [three editions](https://www.visualstudio.com/downloads): Community, Professional, and Enterprise. All of these editions will work with the Rhino C/C++ SDK.

*Note*: Rhino C/C++ SDK plugins **cannot** be authored in versions of Visual Studio other than 2017. The native classes and libraries that are made available via the Rhino C/C++ SDK are also used internally by Rhino. As a result of this tight linkage with Rhino itself, the libraries are very compiler specific, and work only with the same compiler that was used to build Rhino.

#### Step-by-Step

1. **[Visual Studio 2017 Community Edition](https://www.visualstudio.com/vs/community/)** is free from Microsoft for students, open-source contributors, and small teams. [Details here](https://www.visualstudio.com/license-terms/mlt553321/).  Click the **Community** button to download the installer.
2. Run the **Visual Studio installer** you downloaded from Microsoft, in this case ***vs_community_[build_number].exe***.

3. Follow the onscreen prompts to install Visual Studio. Make sure to select all of the **Desktop development with C++** features.

4. Depending on your internet connection, this can take minutes or hours.

## Install the Rhino C/C++ SDK

The **Rhino C/C++ SDK** is a set of tools for creating plug-in using the C++ language. The SDK includes headers, libraries and Visual Studio project wizards to get you started creating plugins quickly.

1. Exit **Visual Studio**.
2. Download the **[Rhino C/C++ SDK](https://www.rhino3d.com/download/rhino-sdk/beta)**.
3. Run the **SDK installer** you downloaded, in this case ***rh60sdk_[build_number].msi***.
4. If the installation is successful, run Visual Studio.
