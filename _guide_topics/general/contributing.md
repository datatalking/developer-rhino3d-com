## GitHub

Many [McNeel projects](http://github.com/mcneel) are open-source and on [GitHub](http://github.com/).  [RhinoCommon](https://github.com/mcneel/rhinocommon) - our cross-platform .NET SDK - is a great example. Even [this very website](https://github.com/mcneel/developer-rhino3d-com) you are reading now. Browse source, fork a repo, correct a typo: we welcome participation and pull-requests.

## Discourse

[discourse.mcneel.com](http://discourse.mcneel.com) is the McNeel forum.  This is the fastest place to get help.  Specific categories to post in are:

- [Rhino Developer](http://discourse.mcneel.com/c/rhino-developer): Customizing Rhino through VB, C#, C++, RhinoScript, and Python.
- [Scripting](http://discourse.mcneel.com/c/scripting): Topics related to RhinoScript and Python scripting.
- [openNURBS](http://discourse.mcneel.com/c/opennurbs): Topics related to the openNURBS toolkit.
- [Grasshopper developer](http://discourse.mcneel.com/c/grasshopper-developer): VB, C#, and Python in Grasshopper components.


## Report Bugs

Whenever you encounter something that doesn't work as it should, we'd love it if you could file a bug report.  At McNeel, we use [YouTrack](http://mcneel.myjetbrains.com/youtrack/) to track issues and bugs.  YouTrack requires that you create a login. The vast majority of bugs are visible to the public.  Please report issues or bugs with our APIs or SDKs on YouTrack.
